//Ierative solution
//challenges faced null pointer exception for list1.val < list2.val comparison
//Error was the while statement was with || before, after changing to && it worked fine.
//understanding conditional operators working for our logic, && was the correct one rather then || 
//coz if any of node becomes null the loop needs to stop
